DO NOT INSTALL IT IF YOU ARE NOT COMFORTABLE REPORTING ISSUES OR WORKING WITH SYSTEM FILES**\r\n\r\nHi everyone! It has been awhile since the last beta and you may have noticed that we've skipped over a stable release of Zebra 1.2 in favor of Zebra 2.0. Before I get into the details there are some new things you need to know about alphas of Zebra:\r\n- **For the time being, Zebra 2.0 can only be installed on devices with a Procursus bootstrap.** This is a technical limitation and I hope to have it resolved by the time the full release of Zebra 2.0 comes out.\r\n  - Jailbreaks with a Procursus bootstrap include: Chimera, Odyssey, Odysseyra1n, and Taurine.\r\n  - There are no jailbreaks on iOS 11 that support Procursus\r\n- Betas of Zebra are now installed as a **separate package**. This means that the beta version of Zebra can be installed alongside of the stable version. This also means that you will have to **downgrade** the main Zebra package to 1.1.18 in order to install the Zebra 2.0 beta. This was done to ensure that the user still has a stable package manager while trying out the Zebra beta.\r\n  - If you are experiencing issues after downgrading to Zebra 1.1.18 from the 1.2 betas you will have to delete your database file that is located at `/var/mobile/Library/Application Support/xyz.willy.zebra/zebra.db` and reopen Zebra.\r\n- Zebra 2.0 uses **merged sources list** and will contain the same sources that other package managers like Cydia and Sileo use. If you have extra sources installed exclusively into Zebra 1.x, there is a migration option available in the add source menu.\r\n- This is an **alpha** not a beta. It may be prone to crashing in which case I'm relying on testers to be able to report crashes to me and **very specific** reproduction steps.\r\n- I will also be closing a lot of old issues that applied to the 1.2 betas because they no longer apply. If they still apply in the 2.0 alpha please reopen your issue.\r\n\r\nNow that is out of the way, let's talk about Zebra 2.0 itself. Why did I skip over 1.2? The simple answer is that there was a huge backend rewrite between 1.1 and 1.2. I already rewrote the database backend for Zebra 1.2 but I was not happy with how it turned out as there were several crashes and inconsistencies with the new system. Because of this, I decided to switch Zebra's backend from my own implementation over to `libapt` which is by far more stable and much better at dependency resolution. \r\n\r\nNot many new features have been added since the last 1.2 beta but because of this huge rewrite, a lot of things are currently non-functional as I have not converted them over to the new libapt backend. These features will be added back in a future beta so if you're going to miss them I would suggest not updating quite yet. Here is a list of features that are not currently implemented in Zebra 2.0:\r\n- Source Filters\r\n- Package Filters\r\n- Featured Packages\r\n- Payment API support\r\n- Changes\r\n- Community News\r\n- Favorites\r\n- Ignoring package updates\r\n- Package Sharing\r\n- Source List Export\r\n- Settings\r\n- iOS 12 dark mode\r\n- Package Compatibility\r\n- URI Schemes\r\n- Notifications\r\n- Package swipe actions\r\n\r\nThere may be more features missing that I have not listed here but I will update the list if new ones are found. These features will be reimplemented at some point in the beta process but I wanted to get this initial beta out first to test the new libapt backend before developing new features."}},{"name":"Separator"},{"name":"HeadingView","properties":{"text":"1.1.19"}},{"name":"TextView","properties":{"content":"Fixed in this version:\r\n- Workaround for not being able to send support emails from within Zebra\r\n- Temporarily removed the source clipboard feature"}},{"name":"Separator"},{"name":"HeadingView","properties":{"text":"1.1.18"}},{"name":"TextView","properties":{"content":"Fixed in this version:\r\n- #1813 - Fix for \"repository is broken\" message on newer version of APT\r\n- #1808 - Add compatibility for the Apple Pencil's \"scribble\" writing"}},{"name":"Separator"},{"name":"HeadingView","properties":{"text":"1.1.17"}},{"name":"TextView","properties":{"content":"Fixed in this version:\r\n- #1978 - Modified `extrainst` so that it uses `/bin/sh` instead of `/bin/bash`"}},{"name":"Separator"},{"name":"HeadingView","properties":{"text":"1.1.16"}},{"name":"TextView","properties":{"content":"Fixed in this version:\r\n- Support for the Taurine jailbreak in Community Sources\r\n- Support for Procursus repo if Odysseyra1n is being used in Community Sources\r\n- Procursus repo will be listed in Community Sources if Procursus is detected but no known jailbreak is found"}},{"name":"Separator"},{"name":"HeadingView","properties":{"text":"1.1.15"}},{"name":"TextView","properties":{"content":"Fixed in this version:\r\n- Fixed an issue which would cause su/sling to crash on iOS versions lower than 14."}},{"name":"Separator"},{"name":"HeadingView","properties":{"text":"1.1.14"}},{"name":"TextView","properties":{"content":"Fixed in this version:\r\n- Fixed a crash on iOS 14 that would occur when the 'bold text' accessibility setting was enabled."}},{"name":"Separator"},{"name":"HeadingView","properties":{"text":"1.1.13"}},{"name":"TextView","properties":{"content":"Fixed in this version:\r\n- Fix an issue with slow package installs due to APT wanting to download the package again.\r\n- Potential fix for an issue where prompts for network access would not be shown on devices purchased in China.\r\n\r\nThanks to @Diatrus for his help in fixing both of these issues!"}},{"name":"Separator"},{"name":"HeadingView","properties":{"text":"1.1.12"}},{"name":"TextView","properties":{"content":"Quick update to fix a bug related to resolving dependencies for Procursus' Core Utilities package."}},{"name":"Separator"},{"name":"HeadingView","properties":{"text":"1.1.11"}},{"name":"TextView","properties":{"content":"Hey all!

Read the 1.0 release notes [here](https://github.com/wstyres/Zebra/releases/tag/v1.0).\r\n\r\nHey guys! It is about time for a new Zebra update. I focused on some features left over that I wanted to include in 1.0 but also took time (a lot of time) to fix bugs that were reported since 1.0. 1.1 took longer than I wanted to actually get to release (which leaves me worried about the length of time between now and the next update) but I think that it is finally ready now and I think everyone will be happy with all of the improvements made.\r\n\r\n### What's New?\r\n- **Goodbye, clutter!** You can now filter out packages and authors from your Changes page that you don't want to see.\r\n- **Import sources with ease.** We've created a new \"Import Sources\" view to allow selecting sources that will be imported from another package manager or a previously exported sources file.\r\n- **Life (and Zebras) isn't always Black and White.** Choose from a variety of different accent colors to customize your Zebra experience.\r\n- **Now, what was its name?** A new detailed search tab helps you find the package you're looking for quickly and easily.\r\n- **Improved Payment API Support.** We've reworked our payment API support to be more reliable so there is less confusion about purchasing packages.\r\n- **Parlez-vous français?** You can now pick which language Zebra speaks instead of using your System Language.\r\n- **Context is important.** Support for iOS 13's new Context Menus has been added into Zebra across the app.\r\n\r\n#### Other Additions and Improvements\r\nI've worked very hard to crush lots of bugs and I can't list them all here but I've listed a few notable improvments below:\r\n- Added several missing section icons for many sections that previously had icons in Cydia\r\n- Added a new \"Legacy\" alternate icon\r\n- Zebra will now display faulty sources so that they can be removed\r\n- Added support for .xz and .lzma package files to be downloaded from repositories\r\n- Added a new \"Finish Automatically\" option which will respring, close Zebra, or dismiss the console after installing packages\r\n- You can now long-press on the Queue Bar for a quick way of clearing the queue without opening it\r\n- Added a new \"Reset\" section in Zebra's settings\r\n- Tweaked the \"Installed Files\" view to make for more readable content\r\n- Added a new \"Automatic Refresh\" option that will no longer refresh Zebra's sources automatically when disabled\r\n- Your UDID and other sensitive information (like account email) will now be hidden automatically when a screenshot being taken or screen recording\r\n- Added the ability to export your Wishlist for safekeeping\r\n- Added the ability to sort your Wishlist by most or least recently added\r\n- Packages that are on your wishlist that have been installed are now removed from your wishlist automatically\r\n- firmware.sh (which generates virtual dependencies for dpkg) has been rewritten and improved for reliability on newer iOS versions\r\n- Reworked the local install feature of Zebra. `deb` files that are imported into Zebra will now render a depiction and queue any dependencies needed for local files. It will also respring/uicache if necessary.\r\n- Improved font on the console views\r\n- Tapping any of the tab bar icons while inside of a tab will now scroll to the top of the current view\r\n- When a package has the same version hosted on multiple repositories, an indicator is now displayed in the Downgrade/Upgrade menus to indicate which source it is from\r\n- Zebra will no longer open cydia:// and sileo:// URLs\r\n- Twitter link on the homepage now goes to the @getZebra account instead of my own\r\n- A source's label will now be displayed instead of its origin\r\n- \"Repos\" has been changed to \"Sources\" across the app\r\n- Payment and repository login support is no longer available on iOS 10 and below\r\n- Slightly modified the style of the Packages and Source cells\r\n- Zebra will now attempt to load an entire repo (when loading All Packages) instead of using batch loading\r\n- Support for flat repositories has been improved to allow directories other than the root of a website\r\n- The \"Add from Clipboard\" popup on the Sources List will now only show if you have a verified source in your clipboard\r\n- A warning popup will appear when attempting to add an insecure source\r\n- When installing a package with multiple versions, a popup will now ask which version you'd like to install\r\n\r\nThere were a lot more minor changes and bugs fixed since 1.0 and listing them all here would take too much space. Besides, no one would read them anyway.\r\n\r\n### What's next?\r\n\r\nWe're working on a redesign/rewrite for Zebra to add a lot more functionality with a lot of improvements to UI, speed, and hopefully lots of bugfixes (trying to have a net 0 for bugs on this one).
